NOT WORKING YET!

This tool is used to set up your Windows 10 installation. Once finished it can install software within its GUI. In the background it will use the chocolatey package manager for this. You can also change some important Windows settings with it, like disabling telemetry or peer-to-peer updates.

## Example application list:
By default the Software list on the left hand side is empty. To fill it you can either manually input every package or use the example configuration file in the root directory of this repo.
